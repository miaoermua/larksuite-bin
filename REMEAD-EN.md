# larksuite-bin
AUR [packages/larksuite-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/larksuite-bin)

**Reason**: Lark Suite international version uses timestamps and signatures in the download links. The .deb package needs to be manually downloaded and built, so here in this repository's releases I have cached a deb package file for building the AUR package.

## Limitations of This Repository

- Unable to resolve issues where minor versions are updated but `pkgver` is not.
- Unable to automate downloading and synchronizing to `PKGBUILD`.
- Unable to address inconsistencies in Larksuite content across different countries and regions.

If you do not trust the `.deb` package files provided by this repository, you can manually download from the official Larksuite website:
- https://www.larksuite.com/download  

Then compare the `sha256sums` value in the `PKGBUILD` with the one provided in this repository's releases. If they don't match, you may choose not to use the cached file here and build Larksuite manually instead.
